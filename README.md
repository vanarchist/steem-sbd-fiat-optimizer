# STEEM/SBD To Fiat Conversion Optimizer

## Overview

There is not yet a market for directly using earned STEEM or SBD to make purchases for living essentials such as food, etc. STEEM or SBD must first be converted to a fiat currency such as USD to pay living expenses. More exchanges have been adding trading pairs for STEEM and SBD. This app identifies the optimal transactions to go from STEEM or SBD to the target fiat currency that will result in minimal loss of value. Currently, only USD through GDAX is supported as a target.

More exchanges and fiat currencies will be added in the future both as targets for fiat extraction and intermediaries.
